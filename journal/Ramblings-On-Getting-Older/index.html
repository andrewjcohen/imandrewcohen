              <p>Recently I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about getting older. Nothing concrete, but more-so reflecting on where I am in life. I’m 2.5 months into my marriage and just turned 29. I know that doesn’t seem old, but events around me have had me thinking more about life. It’s not a quarter life crisis, just me reflecting, being thankful, and scared at the same time.</p>
              
              <p>My grandmother is in a bad state of health. People die, but she’s a woman I never thought would. After my grandfather passed away 10 years ago she just kept moving along. While she had bad periods she never seemed to deteriate, until recently. The other day I found myself reflecting on my summers spent at their beach house, sailing with my grandfather, catching crabs, surfing, and just enjoying life.</p>
              
              <p>It seems so long ago I was doing this, in fact 12+ years since I was there. In this time I’ve had so many experiences, good and bad. Twelve years is a long time and a lot can happen then, but it seems just like yesterday my grandfather passed away.</p>
              
              <p>In that time I’ve graduated high school, moved to Washington DC, raced mountain bikes all over the United States, attended and graduated college, found my calling in digital design, visited multiple countries, run my own successful business, been engaged, rescued my dog, been unengaged, made and lost friends, moved to Colorado, helped design a cutting-edge product, been engaged, bought a house, joined a leading consultancy in our field, married my best friend, and a million other things in between.</p>
              
              <p>I’m sure my list could go on for days and days, but my point being is that I’ve done so much in 12 years that I shouldn’t be afraid of the future, but I am.</p>
              
              <p>Recently I’ve found myself feeling a bit of unease. We’ve been talking about having kids in the next few years, our plans for the future, our finances, and generally things that aren’t that easy to discuss. I know there are tons of great and scary things ahead for me, but I guess that’s what makes life a journey. My thoughts have taken my emotions everywhere, and even writing this has been tough. Reality is I am a lucky man, and I should be, scratch that, I am thankful.</p>
