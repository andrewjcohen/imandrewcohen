              <p>I’ve been thinking this for weeks, months, years. It’s something I know is important in my career field as a designer. It’s something that is important as a human being. It’s something that I should do more of. Writing is a creative endeavor that has always alluded me. I’ve never had a successful blog. Successful in the sense that it lasted more than a week.</p>
              
              <p>Writing is a skill that I’ve never truly felt 100% comfortable with.
              You’ll quickly pick up that I’m not the greatest writer in the world, and I know that. I’ve known it since my 7th grade English teacher said “Andrew is not the best writer, but he’s enthusiastic.” Enthusiasm can only get you so far. You need to practice, write, write some more, and just execute. I tell myself the problem is that I just never know what to write about, or the fact I think I’m just not good at it.</p>
              
              <p>The truth is writing is hard for everyone.
              OK, not everyone, but for a large part of the population. For some people it is their creative skill, craft, and passion. To me it has always been something I hated. If I do something I want to be the best I can be at it. Unfortunately the best I can be at writing has always been pretty mediocre. Reality is that I’ve never truly made a concerted effort to get better at it. Practice does make perfect, but for starters you have to actually practice.</p>
              
              <p>I consistently read articles about being a better writer, or how writing 1000 words a day is fantastic exercise for creatives. I love the idea of it, but it has always just been an idea to me. I’m passionate about a lot of things in my life. From design to cycling and everything in between.</p>
              
              <p>I feel I have tons of interests I could write about, I’m just not sure what I’ll write about.
              The reality is that shouldn’t matter. Sometimes I fear it’s me being afraid of others judging, which is strange as that’s never stopped me in other aspects of life. I mean I’m a designer for christ’s sake. My work has been critiqued by peers, denied by clients, and used by plenty. I make my living in one of the most public facing fields so others seeing another “thing” of mine shouldn’t be a big deal right? Wrong.</p>
              
              <p>In the end fear might be my biggest road block.
              However, I can’t let that stop me. You need to get past numerous hurdles in life to grow and become better. I’ve decided that today I stop with the excuses. I stop thinking that I can’t get better. I make a list of the topics and ideas that I should write about. I realize that fear is pointless. I get past this hurdle I’ve had for the longest time. Most of all I start writing and stop being lazy.</p>
