        <p>When not designing I can be found with my wife and son, riding bikes, running, playing games, watching soccer and baseball, or eating burritos. I like to think I'm a busy person that would rather be doing other things than working more after hours, hence this website. However, if you want to see some of my older work visit my <a href="https://dribbble.com/andrewcohen">Dribbble</a>. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewcohen">Twitter</a>. Lastly, you can always <a href="mailto:hi@imandrewcohen">email</a> me.</p>
