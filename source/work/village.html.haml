    %p Our clients came to the thoughtbot Denver team with an idea and nothing more. We started with a product design sprint to help understand the initial problem and find a product-market fit. Through prototyping, user testing, and agile design/development we were able to build a quality product in a small amount of time.

    %p The Village allows users to manage, monitor, and gain insight from their children's internet usage. The product is not about policing, but about learning how your children use the internet. From the insights gained users can find ways to connect with their children on a deeper level.
