<p>Yesterday we soft-launched the new <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> website for the world to see. A few months back my co-worker Corey Haggard and I decided for us to move forward as a company known equally for design and development it was imperative we have a site reflecting that.</p>
<p><span>After a month of brainstorming, designing, and developing we have deployed v 0.1. The reason I say 0.1 is we have tons more in store in terms of animations, case studies, and related to the design of other thoughtbot properties.</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime head over to <a href="thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot.com</a> and check out the new site. It's responsive and looks great across multiple devices and screen sizes.</span></p>
