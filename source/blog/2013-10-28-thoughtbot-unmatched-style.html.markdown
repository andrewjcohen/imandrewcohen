<blockquote class="link_og_blockquote">The Thoughtbot site is a really good experience. It&rsquo;s simple and fast to browse and really feels like a &ldquo;content&rdquo; or &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; first approach. Which is interesting to me, since this is what they do, it&rsquo;s a good idea to really show that off for potential clients and they&rsquo;ve done that really well. I like the decisions they&rsquo;ve made in the mobile to desktop changes in content on the site too. Really worth a study IMHO.</blockquote>
