<p>A few weeks back I had the joy of finally seeing my team Arsenal FC play in England. With vacation winding down we made one last stop. I've been an Arsenal fan for 10+ years and have dreamed of seeing them live, singing, and celebrating alongside my fellow Gooners. Seeing the two new signings, Santi Cazorla and Lukas Podolski putting us up 2-0 at Anfield vs Liverpool was a true joy and something I'll always remember.</p>
