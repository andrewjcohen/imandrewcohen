<blockquote>
<p>Refresh Denver is a community of designers, developers, and other internet professionals working to refresh the creative, technical, and professional culture of their trades in the Denver, CO area.</p>
<p>Our goal is simple: bring together the best and brightest new media professionals in the Denver metro area so that we may learn from one another. Our industry is too rich for any one person to &ldquo;know it all.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where we come in.</p>

<p>I recently stepped up along with a few others to help push Refresh Denver forward. As someone that saw so much benefit from my old group <a href="http://refresh-dc.org">Refresh DC</a> I was saddened to see there wasn't a thriving group here. We're picking up new sponsors, being more open and communicative, and most of all having higher quality speakers. Join us as we're moving forward and hoping to do great things to elevate the Denver community and those within it.</p>
