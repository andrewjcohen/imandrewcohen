<p>"What a shitty hike" was the running joke of the day. Cracker Lake is a trail that sees tons of horse traffic, and tons of horse shit. The first 2 miles of the trail were spent dodging land mines and mud. It figures we'd save this hike for the only day with perfect weather. O<span>nce we got past the worse of it we put on some altitude and ended up at "Church", as the hotel employees aptly called it.&nbsp;</span></p>
