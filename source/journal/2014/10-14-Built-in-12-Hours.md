You probably don’t realize this, but this is a new website. I designed and built it in approximately 12 hours. Last night I initialized a new github repo around 7PM. Tonight I’m writing this post at 10:30PM. While this period is over 24HRS, I’m talking actual time spent working.

This isn’t the first time I’ve built a personal website in a short time. I find personal websites can often turn into a long-drawn out process with too much time spent diddling around. Because of this I’ve set out to design and build a lot of my personal sites in a short timeframe. I find it allows me to make decisions and move forward without second guessing myself. Most importantly, I’m able to ship something of quality and not bog myself down.

First and foremost, when I set out to rework my site I wanted to add a blog. I talk about wanting to write more [online](http://imandrewcohen.com/journal/I-Want-to-Write/), and offline. However, I’ve always been afraid I have nothing worth saying. After a few conversations at Brooklyn Beta last week, I knew this wasn’t the case. I needed to start already. To add more fuel to the fire my first design-centric blog post, [Prototyping Animations in Keynote](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/animating-with-keynote), was published on thoughtbot’s blog yesterday. Turns out it was well received more than I could ever imagine.

After a quick sketch or two, nothing really of note, I set out to build this site. I went straight from pen and paper to code. I decided it was best to host my own solution with a simple static-site generator, [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com). SASS is the pre-processor of choice with thoughtbot’s suite of tools, [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io), [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io) as the obvious choice. Lastly, I moved over to [github pages](http://pages.github.io) for my hosting purposes.

My site is far from done, but after 12 hours of work it’s in a great place. In a short time I was able to take an idea and ship this website. I designed and built a solid foundation for me to iterate on. Most importantly I built a home for my writing to live.
